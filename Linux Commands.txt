* & ? - wild cards can be used in any arguments.
^ starts with & $ ends with should be used only with grep command

pwd(present working directory)

Note :
- ls - lhtra : Includes hidden files as well.
- The options used with ls need not to be in a particular order, any order is fine.

I can used wild cards, but instaed of this grep is used along with ls -lrth)

d - means dir & - means file.
rwxr-x-- : Permissions

user & group

last modified date & time

rm(remove)
=======================
1. To remove files
rm file1 file2 ...........
rm -f : For force delete.

2. To remove directory
a. rm dir - To remove empty directory
b. rm -r dir - To remove a directory with some content(files & subdirectories).

Here 'r' is recursive
rm -rf dir : For force delete

mv(move)
===============
1. To rename files & directories.
mv file_oldname file_newname
Note : If the file_newname alreday exists, then the contents of the file_oldname will be moved to file_newname  & file_oldname will be deleted, so the file_newname should not exists if I want to rename.

mv dir_old dir_new
Note : If the dir_new exists then the dir_old will be moved into dir_new, else it will be renamed.

2. To move files
mv file1 file2 <Destination Dir>

3. To move directoty
mv scr_dir dist_dir

Note : Here distination & source directory should exists. if not I will get "No such directory" error in case when working with different dir.

cp(copy)
===================
1. Basically, it is used to copy file/s from one directory to another.
cp file1.ext file2.ext <Destination Directory>

2. To copy one dir into another
cp -r dir1 dir2

3. To copy the content of one file into another
cp file1 file2(file 1 content will be copied to file2)(override)

Note : If the distination file/directory doesn't exists & then cp command will create & do the the job. But source should be there.

date
============
This command is used to display the current date-time of the Linux server.

Syntax: date

touch
==========================================
This command is used to create an empty file.

Syntax : touch <FileName.ext>
- It will create the file in the pwd, if the file is not present
- If the file is already present then it will change the modification date-time timestamp of the file.

Note:
- File names should not have space.
- I can also create a hidden file, where the File-Name has to begin with. (Ex: .Demo.txt)

cat(catenate)
==============================================
1. To display the content of the file when the content is less if more other relevant command should be used.
cat FileName.ext

2. To concatenate & display the contents of the multiple files
cat FileName.ext FileName.ext ......................

clear
=======================
This command is used to clear the terminal screen

Syntax: clear

Note:
- This will not delete the content in the terminal, it just moves the content up.
- 'cls' command works in some terminals where it actually clears the contents on the screen only.

tail & head
-------------
- tail command is used to display the last part of the file content
- head command is used to display the first part of the file content.

options:
- tail fileName.ext: It will display the last 10 lines of the specified file.
- head fileName.ext: It will display the first 10 lines of the specified file.
- tail/head -<N> fileName.ext: It will display the last/first 'N' lines of the specified file
- I can combine tail & head commands to display the lines in the middle of the file i.e. tail -50 fileName.txt | head -10
- tail -f <fileName.ext>: It is used to display the running/real-time logs. where f represents 'follow-mode'.
- tail -Nf <fileName.ext>
- tail -f <FileNmae.ext> | grep 'something'
- tail -Nf <FileNmae.ext> | grep 'something'

Note : The tail -f commamd will not terminate on it's own, it is a continuous process.

sudo(SuperUserDo)
=================================
It gives the temporary Superuser/root user access to perform restricted actions or access restricted files.

Note: The error when a normal user tries to perform restricted action or access the restricted files is "Permission denied".

syntax: sudo -s
Example:
Before: [centos@TSLEE-BE-02 ~]$
After: [root@TSLEE-BE-02 centos]#

Note:
- $ represents normal user & # represents root/admin user
- I need to use the 'exit' command to switch back to the previous user.
- If I want to perform any action without switching to the root user, I Ian use 'sudo <mkdir sample>', then that action will be performed without the user switch.

ps(process)
====================
process is an instance of the running command or program(Shell script).
Note: - Foreground & Background processes in linux

The ps command in Linux is used to provide information(PID mainly) about currently running/active processes on the system
syntax : ps -[options] [PID]

Note:
- By default the ps command will display the running processes which are initaited by only current user.

options
-------------
-a : used to display information(PID mainly) about running processes(initiated by all users)
-e : Includes all the  kind of active processes in the system.
-f - used to display information about running processes(initiated by current user) in a detailed format(PPID, CPU & memeory usage etc..)

so use ps -aef or ps -ef
ps -ef | grep 'something'

Note : ps PID :  will display information about specified process.

kill
=============
Foreground processes are one which can be killed by ctrl+c i.e. commands usually which I execute in terminal i.e tail -f
The foreround process(tail -f) can be killed by ctrl+c.

Background processes are basically the running programs/shell scripts & these cannot be killed by ctrl+c.
To kill background process running i need to use 'kill' command.

syntax : kill <PID1 PID2,...>

Note:
If I kill parent process, then child will also gets killed

less
=============================
- This command is used to display the content of the file.
- I need to use this command when the content of the file is in many pages & when I want to only see the content & don't wnat to edit it.
- With the less command I can navigate up & down in the displayed content & I can also search the required text, which I cannot do using cat command, because it just displays & exits, so cat should be used only when the content of the file in around one or two pages.

Syntax : less <File_Name.ext>

options after doing less:

- Shift+g : To move to the end of the file
- gg : To move to the top of the file
- pg dn key: To move the page down
- pg up key: To move the page up
- Upper arrow key: To move one line up
- Down arrow key: To move one line down
- :q : to quit the less


How to search the required text after opening the displaying the file content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For bottom to top search(Upward direction, preffered)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Type Shit+g
- Type / to enter the search mode.
- Then type the text to search & enter
- type 'n' to go to the next match(as per timing)
- type 'N' to go to the previous match(as per timing)
- For a new search again use /text
- :q : to quit the less

For top to botton search(Downward direction)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Type gg
- Type ? to enter the search mode.
- Then type the text to search & enter
- type 'n' to go to the next match(as per timing)
- type 'N' to go to the previous match(as per timing)
- For a new search again use ?text
- :q : to quit the less

Note:
- Drawback of the less command is the matching text on which the current control is, that will not be highlighted, so vim command can be used to overcome this.
- The 'more' command is also the same the  as 'less' command, but after doing more will be able to navigate only in the forward direction, not in the backward direction, so the 'more' command is generally not used

vim
============
- vim is a file reader & editor i.e it can used to read & also edit the file content

syntax: vim fileName

Read
~~~~~~~~~
Shift+g : Bot
gg : Top
down key : To move one line down
up key : to move one line up.
pg dn
pg up
:q to quit

Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~
UP
#############
Shift+g
/search text & Enter
N for the previous match(as per the timing)
n for next match(as per the timing)
again /search for new search
:q to quit

DOWN
#############
gg with ?

Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~
'i' - To switch to insert mode from read mode.
Type the text
'esc'- To Escape
:q - To quit
:wq - To save & quit

Note :
- I can use :q! or :wq! to force the respective action.
- It overcomes the drawback of current matching text highlight, which was found with less command.

df(disk free)
==============
df command is used to display the disk space usage of the all the file systems avaliable.

syntax:
df [options]

It works on system level not on the pwd level.

- just df command will diplay the disk space usage of the all the file systems, where the data like size will not be in human readable format i.e. it will be in bytes.
- df -h will display the disk space usage of the all the file systems in human readable format i.e. KB,MB & GB.


regex(regular expression)
=============================================
In the command arguments(not options) I can use the regex

1. '*' wildcard
---------------
a. display all the files of .log extension
ls -lrth *.logs

b. diplay the files with names as translation with any extension
ls -lrth translation.*
here '*' represents any character any number of times(0 times as well)

2. '?' wildcard
----------------
display the .txt files whose name has only two characters & first character starts with a
ls a?.txt
here '?' represents any single character(mandatory)

3. 'or' operator
-------------------
display all the files that have .java or .py extension

ls -l *{.java,.py}

Piping
==================
- Piping is concept by which I can pass the output from one command as an input to another command.
- Multiple commands can be executed one after another by this piping concept.
- '|' - Pipeline operator.

Ex : tail -1000f abc.log | grep '9148632599'

xargs
-------
If I want to pass the output received from one command as an argument(s) not as standard input to next command, then I need to use 'xargs'
Ex: ls *.java | xargs rm
This remove all the .java files from the directory.

grep(global regular expression pattern)
============================================
- It is used for patter matching
- This command is used to search the required pattern in the file content & display the matching lines.

grep 'XYZ' fileName

options
---------
gerp -i 'XYZ' fileName

-i : To ignore case

matching multiple patterns
---------------------------
egrep 'ABC|DEF' fileName

gerp command can be used with other commands when they are giving some output i.e. piping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ls -lrth | grep 'ABC' or tail -f ABC.log | grep '9148632599'

also
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC' to display the lines that starts with ABC
ls -lrth | grep '.log$' to display the lines that ends with ABC
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC*.log$' starts with ABC, inbetween any & ends with .log
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC?.log$' ? IS USED

Note : It is alaways suggested to use the search patter in quotes in grep command. even all the wildcards should be in quotes.

re-direction
=====================
output re-direction
----------------------
ls 1>output.txt : override
- here 1 represents output re-direction and here it is optional

ls >>output.txt : appends

error re-direction
---------------------
cal 15 2023 2>error.txt 
- here 2 represents error re-direction and here it is mandatory.

Note: 
- use '>' to override the existing data in file, if i want to append then I need to use '>>'.
- I can combine like this ls 1>output.txt 2>error.txt

roles & permissions
=====================
There will be three types of roles in linux
user(u)/owner (Person who creates)
group(g) (All the people who are part of the group, in which owner is part of)
others(o) (All the other users)

There will be three types of permission that each user can have
Read (r): The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file and list files/directories,
write(w) : The write perrmission allows user to add, modify & delete the file & directories
Execute (x): The execute permission is primarily associated with files and determines if the file can be executed as a program or script. For directories, the execute permission allows a user to access or traverse or enter the directory. Without execute permission, a directory cannot be entered(cd command) even if the user has read or write permissions on it.

Ex : -rw-r-----    for user, groups & others

Ex1: file : -rwxrw-r--
Ex2: directory : drwxrw-r--

Note: 
values for permissions
read : 4
write : 2
execute : 1
so for 'rwxrw-r--' : 764

chmod(change mode)
======================
This command is used to change the user permissions for file/directories.

I can use chmod command in two ways
a. Symbolic method
b. Numeric method

a. symbolic method
-----------------------
Adding new permissions
----------------------
add 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o 
chmod u+x,g+wx,o+r <filename/directory name>
chmod u+x is also correct

Removing existing permissions
----------------------
remove 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o
chmod u-x,g-wx,o-r <filename/directory name>
chmod u-x is also can be done

Note : 
- It's important to note that the provided command does not override existing permissions; instead, it adds or removes specific permissions.
- I can even do like this u-x,o+x

b. numeric method
------------------------
Ex1: chmod 777 <file/directory name>
Here first 7 represents(4+2+1) i.e. (rwx) to user, similarily the other two 7s for g & o.

Ex2: chmod 745 <file/directory name>
Here adding only read permissions to g & only read & execute permission to o.

Ex3: chmod 700 <file/directory name>
Here adding 7 & removing all permissions for g & o.

Note:
- Specifying the number for all three users is mandatory.
- whenever i use the chmod command in numeric way the previous permissions will be overriden by the new permissions specified in the chmode command, but it is not in case of symbolic method.
