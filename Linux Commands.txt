Piping
==================
- Passing is concept by which I can pass the output from one command as an input to another command.
- Multiple commands can be executed together by this piping concept.
- '|' - Pipeline operator.

Ex1: ls -l | wc -l
EX2: ls -l | less
Ex3: ls -l | head

tee
===========
The output of one command can be sent as an input to two commands by using 'tee' command.
Ex1: ls -l | tee output.txt | wc -l
'tee' will send the output from ls to output.txt & wc.

Ex2: ls -l | tee output.txt 
copy & display on terminal


xargs
==============
If I want to pass the output received from one command as an argument(s) not as standard input to next command, then I need to use 'xargs'
Ex: ls *.java | xargs rm
This remove all the .java files from the directory.


regex(regular expression)

How to search the required text after opening the displaying the file content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Type / to enter the search mode.
- Then type the text to search & enter
- type 'n' to go to the next match
- type 'N' to go to the previous match


Note:

- The 'more' command is also the same the  as 'less' command, but after doing more will be able to navigate only in the forward direction, not in the backward direction, so the 'more' command is generally not used

Note:
- I need to use the 'exit' command to switch back to the previous user.
- If I want to perform any action without switching to the root user, I Ian use 'sudo <mkdir sample>', then that action will be performed without the user switch.
- $ represents normal user & # represents root/admin user


man
================
This command is used to display all the descriptions & options available with the specified Linux command.

Syntax:

ps(process)
====================
process is an instance of the running command or program.
Note: - Foreground & Background processes in linux

The ps command in Linux is used to provide information(PID) about currently running processes on the system
syntax : ps -[options] [PID]

Note: 
- By default the ps command will display the running processes which are initaited by only current user.


options
-------------

Note : ps PID :  will display information about specified process.


kill
=============
The foreround process can be killed by ctrl+c, but to kill background process running i need to use 'kill' process

roles & permissions
=============================================================
There will be three types of roles in linux
user(u)/owner (Person who creates)
group(g) (All the people who are part of the group, in which owner is part of)
others(o) (All the other users)

There will be three types of permission that each user can have
Read (r): The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file or the list of files in a directory.
write(w) : The write perrmission allows user to add, modify & delete the file & directories
Execute (x): The execute permission is primarily associated with files and determines if the file can be executed as a program or script. For directories, the execute permission allows a user to access or traverse the directory. Without execute permission, a directory cannot be entered even if the user has read or write permissions on it

Ex1: file : -rwxrw-r--
Ex2: directory : drwxrw-r--

Note: 
values for permissions
read : 4
write : 2
execute : 1
so for 'rwxrw-r--' : 764


chmod(change mode)
======================
This command is used to change the access permissions of files & directories.

I can use chmod command in two ways
a. Symbolic method
b. Numeric method

a. symbolic method
-----------------------
Adding permissions
----------------------
add 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o 
chmod u+x,g+wx,o+r <filename/directory name>

Removing permissions
----------------------
remove 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o
chmod u-x,g-wx,o-r <filename/directory name>

Note : i can use go-wx or go+wx, adding/removing w & x permissions for the g & o users

b. numeric method
------------------------
Ex1: chmod 777 <file/directory name>
Here first 7 represents(4+2+1) i.e. (rwx) to user, similarily the other two 7s for g & o.

Ex2: chmod 745 <file/directory name>
Here adding only read permissions to g & only read & execute permission to o.

Ex3: chmod 700 <file/directory name>
Here adding 7 & removing all permissions for g & o.

Note: whenever i use the chmod command in numeric way the previous permissions will be overriden by the new permissions specified in the chmode command, but it is not in case of symbolic method


vim
============
