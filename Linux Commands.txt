pwd(present working directory)
--------------------------------
It shows the absolute path of the current working directory.


cd(change directory):
----------------------------
This command is used to change the directory

options
- cd or cd ~ - Home directory of the current user i.e if the user is root then the home directory will be "root".
- cd / - Root directory
- cd .. - Parent directory
- cd ../.. - Move two directories back
- cd <Directory Name> - To move to the specified sub-directory
Note: If the directory name is having space then use "double quotes".

- cd /............ - To absolute path to move any directory from the root directory.


tail & head
-------------
- tail command is used to display the last part of the file content
- head command is used to display the first part of the file content.

options:
- tail fileName.ext: It will display the last 10 lines of the specified file.
- head fileName.ext: It will display the first 10 lines of the specified file.
- tail/head -<N> fileName.ext: It will display the last/first 'N' lines of the specified file
- I can combine tail & head commands to display the lines in the middle of the file i.e. tail -50 fileName.txt | head -10
- tail -f <fileName.ext>: It is used to display the running/real-time logs. where f represents 'follow-mode'.
	
whatis
------------
This command is used to display a brief description of the Linux commands.

Options/Syntax:
whatis <LinuxCommand>

re-direction
=====================
output re-direction
----------------------
ls 1>output.txt
- here 1 represents output re-direction and here it is optional

error re-direction
---------------------
cal 15 2023 2>error.txt 
- here 2 represents error re-direction and here it is mandatory.

Note: 
- use '>' to override the existing data in file, if i want to append then I need to use '>>'.
- I can combine like this ls 1>output.txt 2>error.txt

input re-direction
----------------------
It can also be done
ls 0<input.txt
- here 0 represents input re-direction and here it is optional

Note: I can combine input, output & error re-direction
ls 0<input.txt 1>output.txt 2>error.txt

Piping
==================
- Passing is concept by which I can pass the output from one command as an input to another command.
- Multiple commands can be executed together by this piping concept.
- '|' - Pipeline operator.

Ex : tail -1000f abc.log | grep '9148632599'

tee
===========
The output of one command can be sent as an input to two commands by using 'tee' command.
Ex1: ls -l | tee output.txt | wc -l
'tee' will send the output from ls to output.txt & wc.

Ex2: ls -l | tee output.txt 
copy & display on terminal


xargs
==============
If I want to pass the output received from one command as an argument(s) not as standard input to next command, then I need to use 'xargs'
Ex: ls *.java | xargs rm
This remove all the .java files from the directory.


regex(regular expression)
=============================================
In the command arguments(not options) I can use the regex

1. '*' wildcard
---------------
a. display all the files of .log extension
ls -lrth *.logs

b. diplay the files with names as translation with any extension 
ls -lrth translation.*
here '*' represents any character any number of times(0 times as well)

2. '$' wildcard
----------------
display the .txt files whose name has only two characters & first character starts with a
ls a$.txt
here '$' represents any single character(mandatory)

3. range operator
----------------------
a. display the files whose name starts with a or b or c 
ls [abc]*

b. display the files whose name does not starts with a or b or c 
ls [!abc]*
Note: Here i can use [!a]* as well

c. ls [A-F]*
- represents range
here i can use any characters num, special characters & alpahets(U/L).


4. 'or' operator
-------------------
display all the files that have .java or .py extension

ls -l *{.java,.py}


less
=============================
- This command is used to display the content of the file.
- I need to use this command when the content of the file is in many pages & when I want to only see the content & don't wnat to edit it.
- With the less command I can navigate up & down in the displayed content & I can also search the required text, which I cannot do using cat command, because it just displays & exits, so cat should be used only when the content of the file in around one or two pages.

Syntax : less <File_Name.ext>

options after doing less:

- Shift+g : To move to the end of the file
- gg : To move to the top of the file
- pg dn key: To move the page down
- pg up key: To move the page up
- Upper arrow key: To move one line up
- Down arrow key: To move one line down
- :q : to quit the less


How to search the required text after opening the displaying the file content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For bottom to top search(Upward direction, preffered)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Type Shit+g
- Type / to enter the search mode.
- Then type the text to search & enter
- type 'n' to go to the next match(as per timing)
- type 'N' to go to the previous match(as per timing)
- For a new search again use /text
- :q : to quit the less

For top to botton search(Downward direction)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Type gg
- Type ? to enter the search mode.
- Then type the text to search & enter
- type 'n' to go to the next match(as per timing)
- type 'N' to go to the previous match(as per timing)
- For a new search again use ?text
- :q : to quit the less

Note:

- Drawback of the less command is the matching text on which the current control is, that will not be highlighted, so vim command can be used to overcome this.
- The 'more' command is also the same the  as 'less' command, but after doing more will be able to navigate only in the forward direction, not in the backward direction, so the 'more' command is generally not used


vim
============
- vim is a file reader & editor i.e it can used to read & also edit the file content

syntax: vim fileName

Read
~~~~~~~~~
Shift+g : Bot
gg : Top
down key : To move one line down
up key : to move one line up.
pg dn
pg up
:q to quit

Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bot to Up
#############
Shift+g
/search text & Enter
N for the previous match(as per the timing)
n for next match(as per the timing)
again /search for new search
:q to quit


Bot to Up
#############
gg

Edit
~~~~~~~~~~~
'i' - To switch to insert mode from read mode.
Type the text
'esc'- To Escape
:q - To quit
:wq - To save & quit

Note :
- I can use :q! or :wq! to force the respective action.
- It overcomes the drawback of current matching text highlight, which was found with less command.

grep(global regular expression pattern)
============================================
- It is used for patter matching
- This command is used to search display the lines from the file content, which are the conaining the the specified pattern.

grep 'XYZ' fileName

options
---------
gerp -i 'XYZ' fileName

-i : To ignore case

matching multiple patterns
---------------------------
egrep '(ABC|DEF)' fileName

gerp command can be used with other commands when they are giving some output i.e. piping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ls -lrth | grep 'ABC'

also
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC' to display the lines that starts with ABC
ls -lrth | grep .'log$' to display the lines that ends with ABC
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC*.log$' starts with ABC, inbetween any & ends with .log
ls -lrth | grep '^ABC?.log$' ? IS USED

Note : The search patter should be in quotes in grep command. even all the wildcards should be in quotes.

date
============
This command is used to display the current date-time of the Linux machine

Syntax: date

ls(list)
==================
Options
---------
- ls : To list the names of directories and files present in the working directory.
- ls -l or ll : To long list the names of directories and files present in the working directory, along with premissions, users, groups, size(In Bytes), Moditication time ect..
- ls -lh : The file/sub-directories sizes will be displayed in human readeable format i.e. KB, MB & GB.
- ls -lth : The 't' option sorts the list/dir by modification time, with the newest files or directories appearing first.
- ls-ltrh : lists/dir's files in reverse order of modification time with detailed information and human-readable file sizes

Note :
- ls - latrh : Includes hidden files as well.
- The options used with ls need not to be in a particular order, any order is fine.

I can used wild cards, but instaed of this grep is used along with ls -lrth)
------------------------------------------------------------------
ls -lrth *.java (* is any char, any times, it can be even emptys)
ls -lrth *.lo? (? any single char, mandatory)


rm(remove)
=======================
1. To remove files
rm file1 file2 ...........

2. To remove directory
a. rm dir - To remove empty directory
b. rm -r dir - To remove a directory with some content(files & subdirectories).

Here 'r' is recursive

mv(move)
===============
1. To rename files & directory
mv file_oldname/dir_oldname file_newname/dir_newname

2. To move files
mv file1 file2 <Destination Dir>

3. To move directoty
mv scr_dir dist_dir

Note : Here distination & source directory should exists. if not I will get "No such file or directory" error.

cp(copy)
===================
1. Basically, it is used to copy file/s from one directory to another.
cp file1.ext file2.ext <Destination Directory>

2. To copy one dir into another
cp -r dir1 dir2

3. To copy the content of one file into another
cp file1 file2(file 1 content will be copied to file2)(override)

Note : If the distination file/directory doesn't exists & then cp command will create & do the other job. But source should be there.

cat(catenate)
==============================================

1. To display the content of the file when the content is less if more other relevant command should be used.
cat FileName.ext

2. To concatenate & display the contents of the multiple files
cat FileName.ext FileName.ext ......................

touch
==========================================
This command is used to
Create an empty file.

Syntax : touch <FileName.ext>
- It will create the file in the pwd, if the file is not present
- If the file is already present then it will change the timestamp of the file.

Note:
- File names should not have space.
- I can also create a hidden file, where the File-Name has to begin with. (Ex: .Demo.txt)

clear
=======================
This command is used to clear the terminal screen

Syntax: clear

Note: 
- This will not delete the content in the terminal, it just moves the content up.
- 'cls' command works in some terminals where it actually clears the contents on the screen only.

systemctl
===================
The systemctl command is used to check & change the state of the system services.
	

Syntax:
systemctl <Status/Start/Stop/Restart> <Service File Name>

Note:
- providing the extension i.e. .service along with the service file is not mandatory



sudo(SuperUserDo)
=================================
It gives the temporary Superuser/root user access to perform restricted actions or access restricted files.

Note: The error when a normal user tries to perform restricted action or access the restricted files is "Permission denied".

syntax: sudo -s
Example:
Before: [centos@TSLEE-BE-02 ~]$
After: [root@TSLEE-BE-02 centos]#

Note:
- $ represents normal user & # represents root/admin user
- I need to use the 'exit' command to switch back to the previous user.
- If I want to perform any action without switching to the root user, I Ian use 'sudo <mkdir sample>', then that action will be performed without the user switch.

man
================
This command is used to display all the descriptions & options available with the specified Linux command.

Syntax:
man <Linux Command>


ps(process)
====================
process is an instance of the running command or program.
Note: - Foreground & Background processes in linux

The ps command in Linux is used to provide information(PID) about currently running processes on the system
syntax : ps -[options] [PID]

Note: 
- By default the ps command will display the running processes which are initaited by only current user.


options
-------------
-e - used to display information(PID mainly) about running processes(initiated by all users)
-f - used to display information about running processes(initiated by current user) in a detailed format(PPID, CPU & memeory usage etc..)
Note : ps PID :  will display information about specified process.


kill
=============
The foreround process(tail -f) can be killed by ctrl+c, but to kill background process running i need to use 'kill' command.

syntax : kill <PID1 PID2,...>

Note: 
If I kill parent process, then child will also gets killed


roles & permissions
=============================================================
There will be three types of roles in linux
user(u)/owner (Person who creates)
group(g) (All the people who are part of the group, in which owner is part of)
others(o) (All the other users)

There will be three types of permission that each user can have
Read (r): The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file and list files/directories,
write(w) : The write perrmission allows user to add, modify & delete the file & directories
Execute (x): The execute permission is primarily associated with files and determines if the file can be executed as a program or script. For directories, the execute permission allows a user to access or traverse the directory. Without execute permission, a directory cannot be entered(cd command) even if the user has read or write permissions on it

Ex : -rw-r-----    for user, groups & others

Ex1: file : -rwxrw-r--
Ex2: directory : drwxrw-r--

Note: 
values for permissions
read : 4
write : 2
execute : 1
so for 'rwxrw-r--' : 764


chmod(change mode)
======================
This command is used to change the access permissions of user for files & directories.

I can use chmod command in two ways
a. Symbolic method
b. Numeric method

a. symbolic method
-----------------------
Adding new permissions
----------------------
add 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o 
chmod u+x,g+wx,o+r <filename/directory name>
chmod u+x is also correct

Removing existing permissions
----------------------
remove 'x', 'wx' & 'r' permissions to the file/directory respectively for the u,g & o
chmod u-x,g-wx,o-r <filename/directory name>
chmod u-x is also can be done

Note : 
- It's important to note that the provided command does not override existing permissions; instead, it adds or removes specific permissions.

b. numeric method
------------------------
Ex1: chmod 777 <file/directory name>
Here first 7 represents(4+2+1) i.e. (rwx) to user, similarily the other two 7s for g & o.

Ex2: chmod 745 <file/directory name>
Here adding only read permissions to g & only read & execute permission to o.

Ex3: chmod 700 <file/directory name>
Here adding 7 & removing all permissions for g & o.

Note: 
- whenever i use the chmod command in numeric way the previous permissions will be overriden by the new permissions specified in the chmode command, but it is not in case of symbolic method
- Every time we need to give all the three values it is suggested.

df
===
df command is used to display the disk space usage of the all the file systems avaliable.

syntax:
df [options]

It works on system level not on the pwd level.

- just df command will diplay the disk space usage of the all the file systems, where the data like size will not be in human readable format i.e. it will be in bytes.
- df -h will display the disk space usage of the all the file systems in human readable format i.e. KB,MB & GB.
